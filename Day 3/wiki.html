            By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the
            Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier
            evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains in
            South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[32] The oldest discovered
            archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to
            around the same time.[33] After 6500 BC, evidence for the
            domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
            structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh
            and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[34] These gradually
            developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[35][34] the first
            urban culture in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic,
            mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik
            hills of Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal
            and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley
            Civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history
            predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent
            (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other
            ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across
            the border.[38] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached
            Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar
            and north-east India or both.[39] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a
            substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in
            Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient
            inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[40] In the premises of the
            Changu Narayan Temple, is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the
            first in Nepal since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c. 250 BC).
            By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu
            texts, such as the late Vedic Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the
            post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[41] The Gopal Bansa was the
            oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest
            rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name
            'Nepal'.[42] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over
            16 centuries by some accounts.[43] According to the Mahabharata, the
            then Kirata king went to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In
            the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the
            prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the
            Ganges, and home to King Janaka and his daughter, Sita. Around 600
            BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern
            regions of Nepal. From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a
            prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life,
            founded Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha
            (traditionally dated 563–483 BC).[44] Nepal came to be established
            as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening centuries,
            played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via
            Tibet,[45] and helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

            By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the
            Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier
            evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains in
            South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[32] The oldest discovered
            archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to
            around the same time.[33] After 6500 BC, evidence for the
            domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
            structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh
            and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[34] These gradually
            developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[35][34] the first
            urban culture in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic,
            mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik
            hills of Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal
            and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley
            Civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history
            predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent
            (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other
            ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across
            the border.[38] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached
            Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar
            and north-east India or both.[39] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a
            substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in
            Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient
            inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[40] In the premises of the
            Changu Narayan Temple, is a stone inscription dated 464 AD, the
            first in Nepal since the Ashoka inscription of Lumbini (c. 250 BC).
